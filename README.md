# StreamBurningwND
This repository is for a hydro-correction tool that utilizes national datasets published by U.S. federal agencies. The stream burning process entails integrating vector streamlines into a DEM layer to either lower the elevation at streamline locations or raise the surrounding terrain. 

Allen and Howard (2015) devised a stream-burning technique employing high-resolution airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEMs for a low-lying region in northeastern North Carolina, complemented by ditch features from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). This ArcGIS tool is built upon their research. The toolbox encompasses four codes. Refer to the flowchart (Figure 1) for a detailed overview of the processes.
